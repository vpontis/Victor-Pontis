        I am at MIT studying computer science and physics. I am also working on [CoBattery](http://cobattery.com), a battery case that eliminated the need to plug in your phone.

        Previously I was at [PicnicHealth](https://picnichealth.com) working as a software engineer helping people keep track of, manage, and understand their medical records.
